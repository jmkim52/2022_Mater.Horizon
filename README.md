## Instruction

The electrical properties dataset and modulus dataset contain the data for 4000 cases of OLEDs. 

For the modulus dataset, filename was named as Modulus_[num1]_ [num2].imp, which can be opened by using text editer and python editor. [num1] and [num2] corresponded to the case number and DC voltage number. [num2] were in range of 1 ~ 10 which was 2.2 V ~ 4.0 V, respectively. The device structure and input parameters in the simulation were individually implemented in the modulus dataset files. 

For the eletrical properties dataset, electrical properties of 5 organic layers of OLEDs were listed for 4000 cases.
